It is strongly suggested NOT not to follow/comment/message that profile as a Kerry Shale fan. He can press the block button very fast. The name of the profile suggests it already: That profile was created in a very sensitive context. You will not be able to talk about that in public anyway. The reason you get blocked away there should be very clear. (Kerry Shale had a Twitter profile from 2013 to 2018, but gave it up. I think he simply did not find the time to care for it anymore because he is very busy.)"]</RadzenText>

It is operated/run by another co-host of that podcast. He is also an actor and he has invested a lot of time and energy in the podcast. If you have the urgent need to follow the podcast on Twitter, it will be the best if you disguise as a Bob Dylan fan, no joke. If it is obvious that you are a Kerry Shale fan, you will be blocked. Better follow that podcast on Apple, Spotify, Audible, etc instead. This fan page will currently not advertise the Twitter profile @isitrollingpod because it has no intention to lure Kerry Shale fans in block tirades/rants and to see unlucky Kerry Shale fans afterwards."]</RadzenText>

            <RadzenText TextStyle="TextStyle.Body2">@Translate["Although Kerry Shale seems to be tech-savvy (he has also someone who helps him on that matter), he prefers paper. The website FanBiz tells you how you can get in contact with him in the best possible way. Before you send him a letter, please verify that Sainou's postal address mentioned at FanBiz is the same as mentioned on Kerry Shale's official website. Please also follow the instructions there: \"If you just want to mail a letter with the address above, and do not want anything back, then you can stop reading! If you live in UK send a properly stamped and self addressed envelope (minimum size 8.5\" x 4\") with your request letter and a photo. You can include a piece of cardboard to keep the photo from bending in shipping and also add \"Do Not Bend\" on the envelopes. Send your letter and wait. On average, there is going to be a 3+ month wait for a response. If you do not live in UK, you can purchase your british stamps here. *For information on postage prices to receive a letter from UK click here.\"."]</RadzenText>
